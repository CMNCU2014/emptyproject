<h2>The #emptyproject Repository</h2>
<h4>Created and maintained by <a href="mailto:jhl.jessica@gmail.com">Jessica H. Lu</a>, Ph.D., University of Maryland</h4>

<p>This repository has been created to assist and support researchers, scholars, and community members to learn how to encode text-based, primary source materials in pursuit of "<a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/conference/" target="new">intentionally digital, intentionally Black</a>" projects. You are invited to use this skeleton repository as a basis from which you can develop and grow your own <a href="http://tei-c.org" target="new">TEI</a> work.</p>

<p><b>By using these materials, you affirm your solidarity with the following values:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The promotion of free, public, and open-source resources for the purposes of education, training, and knowledge-making;</li>
<li>The recognition, compensation, and citation of all researchers, scholars, and community members who contribute their physical, intellectual, and emotional labor to support the learning of others; and</li>
<li>The mindful use and critique of digital tools, methods, and platforms to better support the safety, well-being, and liberation of all marginalized groups, especially Black people in the United States and around the world.</li>
</ul>
